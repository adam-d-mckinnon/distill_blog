This is my personal blog, coming to you from Melbourne, Australia. I write about the growing field of People Analytics, mostly through the application of the R language. On this site, you can find my posts which provide both a philosophical perspective regarding advancements in people analytics, along with practical "How To" projects applying different methods (*please learn from my mistakes!*).
